# This script can be used to install packages to
# /opt/ceh/installed/user quickly from the current nixpkgs baseline.
# Of course, without wrappers the resulting installation is not as
# useful as something that is included in Ceh, but you can still
# access the executables through /opt/ceh/installed/user/whatever/bin,
# so good for quick experimentation.
#
# Available packages can be listed  with: ceh_nixpkgs_avail
# To install a package: ceh_nixpkgs_install zsh
# To install a package's i686 version: ceh_nixpkgs_install zsh bit32 1
# Installed packages can be listed  with: ls -l /opt/ceh/installed/user
# Installed packages can be deleted with: rm /opt/ceh/installed/user/zsh
#
# If instead of the current ceh baseline of nixpkgs, you want to use
# the most up-to-date nixpkgs, use nix commands to do that and simply
# use nix-env (which will install into ~/.nix-profile):
#   nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
#   nix-channel --update
#   nix-env -i vim
