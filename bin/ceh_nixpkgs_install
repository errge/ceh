# This script can be used to install packages to the user's nix
# profile quickly from the current nixpkgs baseline.  Of course,
# without wrappers the resulting installation is not as useful as
# something that is included in ceh, but you can still access the
# executables through ~/.nix-profile/bin, so good for quick
# experimentation.
#
# Available packages can be listed  with: ceh_nixpkgs_avail
# Installed packages can be listed  with: nix-env -q '*'
# Installed packages can be deleted with: nix-env -e foobar
#
# If instead of the current ceh baseline of nixpkgs, you want to use
# the most up-to-date nixpkgs, use nix commands to do that:
#   nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/releases/nixpkgs/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
#   nix-channel --update
#   nix-env -i vim
