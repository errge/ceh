# all the 3 required plugins:
#  - google talk,
#  - java,
#  - flash,
# please make sure to remove all the conflicting plugins from your

#
# To make sure everything is OK, use all 3 plugins while running
# firefox from a terminal and watch stderr.
#
# Do not ever mix 64-bit plugins with this 32-bit firefox!
# TODO(errge): an ld_preload hack that purifies this plugin issue, by
# hiding /usr/lib/mozilla, ~/.mozilla/plugins and whatever else that
# is needed.

# To enable google talk plugin and jre plugin.
