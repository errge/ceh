# Don't source anything complicated from this file, because that
# pollutes the user's environment with shell functions.  Also, since
# we're not sure that the user's shell is bash, they may not even work.

# Let's try to keep this file compatible with shells that are used on
# power-user desktops.  Since the user is supposed to source this in
# her .bashrc, this also should run fast (and not fork).  Currently
# tested with zsh and bash.
